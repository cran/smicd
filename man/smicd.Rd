\title{Statistical Methods for Interval Censored (Grouped) Data}
\description{
The package \pkg{smicd} supports the estimation of linear and linear mixed regression
models (random slope and random intercept models)
with interval censored dependent variable. Parameter estimates are obtain
by a stochastic expectation maximization (SEM) algorithm (\cite{Walter et al., 2017}).
Standard errors are estimated by a non-parametric bootstrap in the linear
regression model and by a parametric bootstrap in the linear mixed regression
model. To handle departures
from the model assumptions transformations (log and Box-Cox) of the interval censored
dependent variable are incorporated into
the algorithm (\cite{Walter et al., 2017}). Furthermore, the package \pkg{smicd} has
implemented a non-parametric kernel density algorithm for the direct (without
covariates) estimation of statistical indicators from interval censored data
(\cite{Walter and Weimer, 2018}; \cite{Gross et al., 2017}). The standard
errors of the statistical indicators
are estimated by a non-parametric bootstrap.

\details{
The two estimation functions for the linear and linear mixed regression model
are called \code{\link{semLm}} and \code{\link{semLme}}. So far, only random
intercept and random slope models are implemented. For both functions
the following methods are available: \code{\link{summary.sem}},
\code{\link{print.sem}} and \code{\link{plot.sem}}.

The function for the direct estimation of statistical indicators is called
\code{\link{kdeAlgo}}. The following methods are available:
\code{\link{print.kdeAlgo}} and \code{\link{plot.kdeAlgo}}.

An overview of all currently provided functions can be requested by
\code{library(help=smicd)}.
